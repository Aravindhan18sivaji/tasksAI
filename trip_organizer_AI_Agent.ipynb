      "\n",
      "**Best City Justification:** The itinerary effectively incorporates the traveler's interests in swimming, dance, and sports across Auckland and Queenstown. Auckland offers city exploration, dance studios, and access to swimming opportunities (Waiheke Island). Queenstown provides opportunities for adventurous sports activities and stunning natural scenery.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Current Weather Forecast (March 2025 - Estimated):**  March in New Zealand is typically mild to warm, with temperatures ranging from 17-21°C (63-70°F) in Auckland and slightly cooler in Queenstown.  However, weather can be unpredictable with rain possible.  A reliable weather forecast closer to the travel dates should be checked.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Upcoming Cultural or Seasonal Events (March 2025):**  Specific event details require further research closer to the travel dates using updated online resources.  Check local event calendars for Auckland and Queenstown for detailed information on festivals, concerts, or cultural performances.  The World Street Dance Championships (if in 2025) is a potential highlight in Auckland.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Estimated Flight Costs from Chennai (March 2025):**  Online searches indicate round-trip flights from Chennai to Auckland could range from $856 to over $1000 USD (depending on the booking platform, specific dates, and airline).  Flights to Queenstown would likely add extra cost as they involve a connecting flight from Auckland.  Booking in advance is strongly recommended for better prices.  Prices are estimates and actual prices may vary.\n",
